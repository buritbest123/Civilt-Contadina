## 📖 **Overview:**

Welcome to **Civiltà Contadina**, a short novel game developed entirely using Scratch! 🌾 The title, *Civiltà Contadina*, is Italian for "Farming Culture" 🌿. This game follows the story of **Ethan Wake**, a character who leaves the bustling capital city for the peaceful countryside. Through this narrative, players can experience the simplicity and challenges of rural life.

This project is a culmination of my skills in **gameplay design, storytelling, user interface design, illustration, sound design**, and **Scratch scripting**. Everything you see, hear, and interact with in the game is crafted by me 🎨.
